# -Anisotropy_and_formability

Through this algorithm, it is possible to calculate the anisotropy coefficients of a sheet metal at 0°, 45° and 90° in relation to the rolling direction, in addition, the normal and mean planar anisotropy coefficients are also calculated. In addition, there is also a function that allows the user to automatically know the classification of a stamping based on the Erichsen test graph by entering only the measurements of the thickness of the metal sheet and the depth of the stamped cup in mm.
